# Front-end Development Template In Webpack

Disclousure: The `webpack-config` are verbatim from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpGLUVbqoYQ&t=75s" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> Youtube Video.

The idea is to use this webpack as a template to build frontend projects, and to tweek it as needs arise.

To run dev server:
`npm run start`

To build:
`npm run build`
